# Dark Room

A simple CSS and JavaScript experiment by [Giona](http://giona.net/).

The whole browser window is covered in darkness.  
You can explore it only through the cone of light of a match.  
When you'll reach an "hidden target", the light-cone will expand.  

In the [demo](http://gionaf.com/playground/darkroom/) there are 6 hidden targets,  
can you find them all?
